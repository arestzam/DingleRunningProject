# DingleRunningProject
The concept for creating this group project with Eoin and Patricia is to develop a web application which allows the user to participate in a marathon race project. There is an option to create a new user account, input personal details, choose favourite race event to participate and finally proceed with checkout payment. The app is interactive, user friendly, clear content and good web page layout. It is also unique as there are validation controls for double entry registration, correct payment details for each user and finally the option to amend account details.
